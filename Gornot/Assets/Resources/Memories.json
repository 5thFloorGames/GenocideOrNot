You'll keep finding them in your shoes long after your holidays are over.","\n","^And in your hair, in the pockets of your jacket, in your bag.","\n","^In the insides of your ears even, if you decide to lie down, your eyes closed, and listen to the sounds of the sea (See: Exhibit 1.7. ???).","\n","end",{"#f":3}],"firstflowers":["^the first flowers after a long winter","\n","^You had put your winter boots away already. They’re in the back of the closet now, waiting for the next time you walk on a frozen lake (See: Exhibit 1.2. Walking on a frozen lake).","\n","^Today the sun woke you up even earlier than yesterday (See: Exhibit 2.5. The sun hitting your face in the morning).","\n","^You're strolling down a street with a name you can't ever remember: maybe you're running late for a bus, maybe you're about to meet someone who makes you smile, maybe you have no particular destination, or maybe it doesn't matter.","\n","^Then you spot them. Hiding in the blades of grass, the first flowers of this spring.","\n","end",{"#f":3}],"crushingice":["^crushing thin ice on top of puddles","\n","^The air smells misty now (Related: Exhibit 4.5. Mist on the meadow). It's late autumn and everything is preparing for a winter's sleep.","\n","^You can feel the world yawn gently. The puddles, remnants of the autumn downpours, have started to freeze overnight.","\n","^Sometimes you step on them intentionally – you must look so weird from a distance, dancing across the street like that.","\n","^The thin layer of ice on top of the puddles cracks under your feet like a broken phone's screen.","\n","end",{"#f":3}],"dandelion":["^blowing dandelion seeds","\n","^They bloomed only a couple nights ago. The whole field was full of yellow flowers that smelled sweet and sticky.","\n","^Now their soft heads are full of seeds that fly away with every breath of a stronger wind.","\n","^You pick one up carefully and gently blow, watching the seeds float away like tiny parachutes.","\n","^Some people believe that they will carry your wishes with the wind.","\n","end",{"#f":3}],"clovers":["^randomly finding four leaf clovers","\n","^You’re not supersticious - you wouldn’t change your path if a black cat crossed it (Related: Exhibit 2.5. Feeling a cat purr under your hand).","\n","^But it’s always nice to find a clover with four leaves instead of three.","\n","^Maybe you like the surprise of it, maybe it makes you feel unique - like you’re the chosen one.","\n","^You pick the clover that had picked you, and place it between the pages of this book you had grabbed from the library.","\n","^It will dry there between 136 and 137 and you will probably forget to take it out.","\n","^Then someone else can find it and feel unique - that is, if they like the book enough to reach page 136.","\n","end",{"#f":3}],"leaves":["^looking at leaves from under a tree","\n","^“Are you a sunshine person or a shade person?”, asks a friend as you enter a park.","\n","^“Half and half”, you reply: you like to hide your face from the sun, but not the legs.","\n","^So that’s what you do.
